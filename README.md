# boolean calculator
- written in x86 assembly language, this code is designed to implement a simple calculator program that performs bitwise operations on two signed 32-bit integers
- used procedures: operationAND, operationOR, operationNOT, operationXOR, exitMenu: Procedures implementing bitwise AND, OR, NOT, XOR operations, and program exit
- the program will  prompt the user for two integers, perform the bitwise operation, and display the result as an output

# big_endian_little_endian conversion
- utilizes x86 assembly instructions to manipulate the individual bytes of the big-endian value
- stores values in a DWORD-sized variable called "littleEndian"
- designed to convert a 4-byte big-endian value (10h, 20h, 30h, 40h) into its little-endian representation
